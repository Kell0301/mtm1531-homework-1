##Excerpt

Part One
Chapter I: A Shifting Reef 

The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention the rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularily excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries and the Governments of several states on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. 

For some time past vessels had been met by "an enormous thing", a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.
